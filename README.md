# Technikum

This repository consists of my old projects that I made during the second school period.
Below are the descriptions of the most memorable ones.

In C++ I made a command line diary that involved reading/writing in text file data that the user inserted with date and time. It also allowed the user to edit his posts by choosing text lines to edit.

In C# I made a Windows Forms program that had a custom border shape that allowed to choose between a calculator and a pointer watch showing computer local time. This was a challenge from my programming teacher to get the highest grade from his school subject, which at the end I received.

In HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), SQL I made a website from ground up that had to imitate a library system. The whole idea was that the user after logging in could view the book covers arranged in grid tiles layout. After clicking the chosen book, he was shown a "rent a book" button that was green or red, depending on the book availability from the database. The admin was shown an "add new book" tile in the place of the newest added book that allowed him to add new books to the database along with its author and title. The website also had a search bar at the top bar that displayed the selected books, both from the author and the title. On the side, there was a tile showing the most popular book based on the number of comments, as the website also had this function.

I made a web forum in which the users were able to add new posts, view, comment and vote on the other publications. You were able to use the search bar to find posts of the other users by their nickname, title of the post or the content. You could see on the side the most popular ones as well as the ones with the biggest amount of comments. Unfortunately, it isn't on the repository because I didn't download it from the school servers and the school admin deleted our accounts as we were graduating without telling us before doing so. Half of the systems were based on the previous library project.
